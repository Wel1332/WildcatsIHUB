# Wildcats’ iHub 🎓🚀

The **Wildcats’ iHub** is a web-based platform designed to address inefficiencies in managing and accessing **student-developed systems** within the university. Unlike general project-sharing platforms, this hub is tailored specifically for **IT and CS students**, serving as a centralized and searchable repository of academic projects.  

It enables both technical and non-technical students to **easily view, access, and use student projects** through live links, motivating innovation and ensuring student outputs gain visibility beyond the classroom.
